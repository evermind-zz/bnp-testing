# Script Summary:
#
# Compares Java source code changes between two Git tags in the NewPipe upstream repository,
# mapping them from the 'main' flavor to the 'braveLegacy' flavor used in this fork.
#
# It assumes the existence of two directory structures:
# - app/src/main/java/         (original upstream code)
# - app/src/braveLegacy/java/ (forked or legacy version)
#
# For each file in the legacy source directory (excluding ones prefixed with 'Brave'),
# it locates the corresponding file in the main flavor and prints the `git diff` output
# between the specified tags. The diff paths are rewritten to show legacy paths for easier comparison.
#
# Requirements:
# - The upstream remote must be set (e.g., via `git remote add upstream https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe`)
# - You must run `git fetch upstream --tags` before running this script (if you want to work with tags
#
# Example usage:
# - Set the oldVersionTag and newVersionTag to define the range of changes. (commit hashes also work
